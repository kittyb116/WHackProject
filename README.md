# EcoPet AI: AI Energy Companion
As part of the 2025 Wellsley Hackathon: EcoPet AI is a tool we developed that allows users to input a prompt intended for a GenAI model, then recommends the most energy-efficient LLM models from the top 50 based on the category of their task. Our application shows users the CO₂ cost of different model choices, calculated through a machine-learning data prediction score. This hopes to help them understand and be aware of more sustainable and efficient options. To incentivize better choices, it features a virtual pet which gains more XP as you conserve CO₂ through efficient model and prompt usage. The energy you save can be spent to unlock cute outfits and accessories—while wasteful or excessive usage loses XP.

# How It Was Built 

Data prediction & Calculating Co2 score: sourced top 50 ranked LLM models from HuggingFace for overall tasks. Trained XGBoost prediction model on data we found on token/inference speed and data center locations for each of the companies to create a CO2 emissions score.

FastAPI: Task classification and recommendation algorithm; endpoints

React + Vite + Tailwind: UI components; Vercel for frontend deployment

# Challenges
Main challenges we ran into was not finding enough research or publicly available data around LLM model efficiency based on prompt use and a direct connection to environmental impact. This pushed us to use machine learning models to predict what the estimated grams of CO2 generated by different requests.


# What's Next
As a hackathon project, we are currently working for more support and features to better integrate into user experience.

Creating a browser extension for better web integration for day-to-day use.
User Leaderboard and local/global ranking of how much each user is saving in co2 based use of app; team challenges, share your pet's outfits; community focus
Integration and support for local LLM download for users -- would further decrease user carbon footprint
Image/text/video support
Unlock different creatures based on total CO₂ saved
Partnerships where we convert saved CO₂ into real tree-planting credits - so exciting!
API for developers so other can apps integrate our recommendation engine
More accurate and specific CO₂ measures for each prompt employing deeper research findings and building datasets for this use-case.
